# About

I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer currently working at Bitcoin Depot.  Previously, I worked at IBM.  I live in Atlanta, Georgia, United States.

Iâ€™m a passionate programmer focused on Bitcoin, Lightning, Linux, open source software, self-hosting, and other technologies that enable privacy and freedom.

My goal is to build software that facilitates the spread of digital and financial self-sovereingty so that everyone has the opportunity to opt out of the current system.

# Professional Experience

I have been professionally develping software since 2019.  Prior to that, I provided IT systems administration and support for small businesses.  Resume available upon request.
