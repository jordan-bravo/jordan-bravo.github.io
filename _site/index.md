# About

I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer currently working at IBM.  I live in Atlanta, Georgia, United States.

Iâ€™m a passionate programmer focused on Bitcoin, Lightning, Linux, open source software, self-hosting, privacy technology, and digital self-sovereignty.

My goal is to build software that facilitates the spread of digital and financial self-sovereingty so that everyone has the opportunity to opt out of the current sytem.
